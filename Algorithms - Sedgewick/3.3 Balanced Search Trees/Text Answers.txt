3.3 Balanced Search Trees

3.3.3 
To get a tree of height 1, we need the tree to consist of only 3-nodes.

3.3.9
i.)  No, does not have perfect black balance.
ii.) No, F is larger than E yet on its left.
iii.) Yes
iv.) Yes

3.3.13
True

3.3.14
The new key gets added to the right of the rightmost subtree.
As the tree fills up, the red links move up the tree as we correct
right-leaning links and 4-nodes. The height of the tree gradually
increases.

3.3.15
False.

3.3.19
2 bits per node. That is, we would need another colour for 5,6,7,8-nodes.

3.3.20
(2^1-1) = 1. For 1 node, the internal path length (ipl) is 0.
(2^2-1) = 3. For 3 nodes, the ipl is 2.
(2^3-1) = 7. For 7 nodes, the ipl is 10.
(2^4-1) = 15. For 15 nodes, the ipl is 34.
That is, the ipl of the next level of the tree is the ipl of the
previous level of the tree plus the length from root to any node
in the last level multiplied by the number of nodes in that level.

Let n be the power, where n>=1, and N be the number of nodes. Then (2^n)-1 = N.
To get the internal path length of a red-black tree with N nodes, we can deduce the
following equation:
(1 * 2^1) + (2 * 2^2) + (3 * 2^3) + ... + (n-1)*(2^(n-1))
This is an arithmetic-geometric equation, and if we solve it (omitted), we get
the following:

ipl = 2 + (2^n)(n-2).

As (2^n)-1 = N, then n = log_2(N+1), so we can also use
this equation:

ipl = 2 + (N+1)(log_2(N+1) - 2)

3.3.22
One order would be CEBDFA.

3.3.24
The worst case scenario happens just before the tree is able to balance itself. The tree is perfectly balanced when its number of nodes, N, is a power of 2 minus 1 (e.g. when N=7, as we can see from Exercise 3.3.5.).
In the worst case, several red nodes in a row occur on the left side of the tree, which can be achieved by adding the keys so they always get added to the left, e.g. if the keys are added in reverse order. If we look at N=6, the longest path from root to null link 4, which equals 2lg(6).
