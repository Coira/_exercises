Exercises from Algorithms - Part 1, Sedgewick and Wayne

To run the code, you'll need stdlib.jar from the book's (introcs.cs.princeton.edu/java/stdlib/)[page],
and to point your classpath to the location of the jar file, e.g.

> javac -cp ../libs/stdlib.jar;. file.java

> java -cp ../libs/stdlib.jar;. file

That is, if stdlib.jar is in a folder libs, we add libs/ and current directory to classpath and look in those locations for stdlib.jar and .java and .class files.
