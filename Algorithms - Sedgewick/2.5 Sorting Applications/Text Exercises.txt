2.5 Applications

2.5.1
The line checks whether the two Strings are the same object, and if so, we can skip the whole comparing part and return true.

2.5.3
The small discrepency between the balance being 0 and it being between -0.005 and +0.005 can easily add up when there are thousands or millions of compares. Compare the balances as two arrays, returning +1 or -1 when a difference between a[i] is found, and 0 if the arrays match up.

2.5.5
Let's say we have the following array, a:

position 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7
value    4 4 3 4 7 1 3 4

and that i is at position 0 and j is at position 1. j will move from left to right, looking for the smallest value within a[1] to a[N-1]. It will find the value 1 at position a[5], which will be swapped with a[i] (that is, a[0]). This will swap the order of the two 4s at the beginning, so that the 4 that was at a[0] and in front of the 4 at a[1], will now be at a[5]. Thus the algorithm is not stable due to the swap we do when placing a[min] into the correct position.
